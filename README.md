# Selected Projects by Sean Henry

[Text-Based Horror] (https://github.com/TextBasedHorror/TextBasedHorror)
---
This is a collaborative project by students at The Tech Academy. I was given ~2100 lines of JavaScript and associated html and css files and asked to make several changes.
I succeeded in getting through two burndown lists in a single, 2-week sprint. Some of the things I changed or fixed:
* **Font Changes:** I found the bug that was keeping many of the fonts in the program from working, and made about a half-dozen font changes to various parts of the game
* **Button Improvement:** Using CSS, I improved the look and feel of the buttons.
* **Bug Fixes:** I found and squashed several bugs.
* **Contact Form Functionality:** The old contact form was ugly and didn't work. I made a new, beautiful contact form and added full functionality to it.
* **Change Save Method:** There was a back button in-game when I started, but the client wanted that functionality to be taken care of using the in-browser back button. I changed the way the game stored its save-state to make this happen.

[Proto-Twitterbot] (https://github.com/HenryProjects/ProtoTwitterBot)
---
Shannon Henry and I collaborated on a Python twitterbot that watches for Donald Trump to post on Twitter. When it finds a new post, it replies with a randomly generated Shakespearean insult. You can follow the bot on twitter (@BardVs45) or click the link above to check out the source code.

***
[File Backup App] (https://github.com/HenryTech/Python-File-Transfer)
---
This is an app I built in stages, creating each module before adding it to the whole. It includes a GUI and uses a SQLite table to track time of last backup and only backup recently edited files.

***
[Pizza Order Form] (https://github.com/HenryTech/PizzaOrderForm/tree/master)
---
This is an app that allowed me to stretch my knowledge of DOM manipulation using both JQuery and vanilla JavaScript.

***
[Library Database] (https://github.com/HenryTech/LibraryManagerSQLProject)
---
Creating this relational database for a small library system with several branches really forced me to learn how to manage relations between tables and write queries. I also imported most of the books used from my own personal library, so I had to figure out how to import a csv file into SQL Server.

***
[HenryDVD Web App] (https://github.com/HenryTech/HenryDVD/tree/master)
---
My final project at The Tech Academy allows me to track the location of all the DVDs in my house and sort them by various categories (including location) as well as search through them or see which actors are in which movie.
